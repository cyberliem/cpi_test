# Solana CPI demo: How to CPI to an onchain program without IDL/ source code.

we're trying to invoke a program on devnet https://solscan.io/account/2ugA7VFzmbfQHsahzzLhQqLkDxmmV1qVrRc4L2U2uDp2?cluster=devnet
without its IDL/ source code.

The steps were explained in the lecture. There is a small "hacking" exercise you can do in tests/cpi_test.ts. Try to figure it out and open a new power to be able to CPI anything in solana.

Modify the test file and run anchor test to find out. You will need to setup your wallet and receive some airdrop on dev net.
